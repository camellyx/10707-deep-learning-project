\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Many of the recent successes of deep reinforcement learning have been in
single agent domains, where an agent's reward depends only on its own actions.
However, several important and interesting problems in communication, robotics
and gaming involve interactions between multiple agents. In multi-agent
environments, agents should ideally learn to predict the actions of other
agents while also determining their own actions. Unfortunately, traditional
reinforcement learning approaches such as deep Q-learning and policy gradient
methods struggle to learn in these environments, as they have each agent learn
an independently optimal function.
% TODO we will compare three algorithms (MADDPG, DDPG, and evolutionary)
For our course project, we propose
employing a new algorithm called MADDPG~\cite{lowe2017multi} for centralized
multi-agent learning in various tasks involving cooperation and competition.
Specific examples of tasks where we will use MADDPG include coordinating
traffic signals and communication over a noisy channel. Techniques for
improving the performance of MADDPG will also be explored.
